# My personal website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4ef7dea5-3fd7-4fdc-a29e-bc5dc57f1bcd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mokhtari/deploys)

My current website is a React and Next.js powered portfolio that showcases my
ongoing learning journey. By combining the flexibility of React with the
server-side rendering capabilities of Next.js, I've created an interactive and
visually appealing portfolio.

To enhance the user experience, I incorporated Chakra UI's pre-built components
and styling options, resulting in a polished interface that perfectly
complements the overall design. This project has not only expanded my knowledge
of React but also provided valuable experience in leveraging Next.js' powerful
features.
